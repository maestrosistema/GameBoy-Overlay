# GameBoy Overlay

# OVERVIEW

This is an updated version of my GameBoy overlay for RetroArch I made back in 2017 (<a href="https://forums.libretro.com/t/gameboy-touch-overlay/12469">RetroArch Forums</a>).

I've updated it for modern 21:9 (2400x1080) screen Android devices.

# INSTALLATION

1. Download latest release.

2. Copy the <b>gb-portrait</b> folder inside: 
<i>"RetroArch/overlays/misc"</i> (Or any folder you set for overlays in RetroArch settings) and overwrite if asked.

3. Boot any GB or GBC game (the Gambatte core is recommended), go into the menu and change these settings:
Video:
